Building upon:
    Play framework 2.0  http://www.playframework.org/       (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

Usage:
    Since you have already successfully unzipped the ScaQCMS, now all you need to do is run it.

    Linux (you need to be in this folder):
        chmod +x start
        ./start

    Now the ScaQCMS is running and you can access it via web-browser in address http:\\localhost:9000

Developing:
    Source code available in github https://github.com/n-a-g-r-o-m/ScaQCMS

    In order to compile, you need to have SBT (https://github.com/harrah/xsbt) installed to your system.

    When SBT is installed you just run command "sbt" in this folder and you will get to sbt console.

    Some commands in SBT console:
        compile - Compiles changed sources
        run - Compiles changed sources and runs the application (re-compiles on "UI refresh" if sources have changed)
        doc - Compiles changed sources and generates an API documentation
        dist - Compiles changed sources and generates distribution ZIP package.
