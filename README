Building upon:
    Play framework 2.0  http://www.playframework.org/

Developing:
    Source code available in github.
    https://github.com/n-a-g-r-o-m/ScaQCMS

    In order to compile, you need to have SBT installed to your system.
    https://github.com/harrah/xsbt

    When SBT is installed, simply run command "sbt" in this folder and
    you will get to sbt console.

    Some commands in SBT console:
        compile Compiles changed sources

        run     Compiles changed sources and runs the application.
                You can access the UI in address http:\\localhost:9000
                NOTE: This re-compiles on "UI refresh" if sources have changed

        doc     Compiles changed sources and generates an API documentation

        dist    Compiles changed sources and generates distribution ZIP package.

        clean   Cleans all compiled class files etc. use after heavy re-factoring

Usage:
    If you received this as an distribution package (created with dist-command),
    then all you need to do is unzipped the ScaQCMS and run it.

    Linux (in the folder where ScaQCMS was unzipped):
        chmod +x start
        ./start

    Now the ScaQCMS is running and you can access it via web-browser
    in address http:\\localhost:9000
